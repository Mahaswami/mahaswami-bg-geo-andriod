# Change Log

## [Unreleased]
- [Fixed] Android 5 geofence limit.  Refactored Geofence system.  Was using a `PendingIntent` per geofence; now uses a single `PendingIntent` for all geofences.
- [Fixed] Edge-case issue when executing `#getCurrentPosition` followed immediately by `#start` in cases where location-timeout occurs.
- [Changed] Volley dependency to official version `com.android.volley`
- [Changed] When plugin is manually stopped, update state of `isMoving` to `false`.
- [Fixed] If location-request times-out while acquiring stationary-location, try to use last-known-location

## [1.0.1] 2016-03-14
- [Changed] Standardize the Javascript API methods to send both a `success` as well as `failure` callbacks.
- [Changed] Upgrade plugin for react-native `v0.21.0`
- [Changed] Document new installation steps
- [Changed] Upgrade `emailLog` method to attach log as email-attachment rather than rendering to email-body.  The result of `#getState` is now rendered to the email-body
- [Changed] Android `getState` method was only returning the value of `isMoving` and `isEnabled`.  It now returns the entire current-configuration as supplied to the `#configure` method.
- [Added] Intelligence for `stopTimeout`.  When stop-timer is initiated, save a reference to the current-location.  If another location is recorded while during stop-timer, calculate the distance from location when stop-timer initiated:  if `distance > stationaryRadius`, cancel the stop-timer and stay in "moving" state.
- [Added] New debug sound **"booooop"**:  Signals the initiation of stop-timer of `stopTimeout` minutes.
- [Added] New debug sound **"boop-boop-boop"**: Signals the cancelation of stop-timer due to movement beyond `stationaryRadius`.
- [Added] `mapToJson`, `jsonToMap` methods.
- [Added] CHANGELOG
- [Added] Document `#getLog`, `#emailLog`
- [Fixed] When using setConfig to change `distanceFilter` while location-updates are already engaged, was mistakenly using value for `desiredAccuracy`

## [1.0.0] - 2016-03-08
- [Changed] Introduce new per-app licensing scheme.  I'm phasing out the unlimited 'god-mode' license in favour of generating a distinct license-key for each bundle ID.  This cooresponds with new Customer Dashboard for generating application keys and managing team-members.
- [Changed] Upgrade plugin for react-native v `0.20.0`.

## [0.4.0] - 2016-02-28

- [Fixed] Fix bug transmitting `motionchange` event.
- [Fixed] HTTP listener not being called on server error
- [Fixed] Fix location-timeout; wasn't being fired in right thread.
- [Added] `#insertLocation` method for manually adding locations to plugin's SQLite db
- [Added] `#getCount` retrieve count of records in plugin's SQLite db.
- [Changed] Upgrade react-native dep to 0.19.0
- [Changed] Significant refactor of `LocationManager`
- [Changed] SQLite multi-threading support.
- [Changed] Native HTTP layer will not follow HTTP `301` (redirect) response.
- [Changed] Cache `odometer` between app restart / device reboot.
- [Added] `@param {Boolean} foregroundService` Allow service to run as "foreground service".  This makes the service more impervious to closure by OS due to memory pressure.  Since a foreground service must display a persistent notification in Android notifiction-bar, config-params for modifying the `@param {String} notificaitonTitle`, `@param {String} notificationText` and `@param {String} notificationColor`.
- [Added] Methods `getLog` and `emailLog` for fetching the current applicaiton log at run-time.

## [0.3.1] - 2016-02-20
