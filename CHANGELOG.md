- [Added] Intelligence for `stopTimeout`.  When stop-timer is initiated, save a reference to the current-location.  If another location is recorded while during stop-timer, calculate the distance from location when stop-timer initiated:  if `distance > stationaryRadius`, cancel the stop-timer and stay in "moving" state.

## [1.0.0] - 2016-03-08

Since a foreground service must display a persistent notification in Android notifiction-bar, config-params for modifying the `@param {String} notificaitonTitle`, `@param {String} notificationText` and `@param {String} notificationColor`.
