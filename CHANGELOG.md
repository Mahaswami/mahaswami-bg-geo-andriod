# Change Log
## [Unreleased]
- [Changed] `Scheduler` will use `Locale.US` in its Calendar operations, such that the days-of-week correspond to Sunday=1..Saturday=6.

## [1.2.3] - 2016-05-25
- [Fixed] Rebuild binary `tslocationmanager.aar` excluding dependencies `appcompat-v7` and `play-services`.  I was experiencing build-failures with latest react-native since other libs may include these dependencies:
- [Fixed] App will no longer crash when license-validation fails.
- [Fixed] Android `GeofenceService` namespace was changed from `com.transistorsoft.locationmanager.GeofenceService` to `com.transistorsoft.locationmanager.geofence.GeofenceService`.  Your `AndroidManifest.xml` will have to be modified.  See installation guide in [Wiki](https://github.com/transistorsoft/react-native-background-geolocation-android/wiki/Installation)

## [1.2.2] - 2016-05-07
- [Changed] Refactor HTTP Layer to stop spamming server when it returns an error (used to keep iterating through the entire queue).  It will now stop syncing as soon as server returns an error (good for throttling servers).
- [Fixed] bugs in Scheduler

## [1.2.1] - 2016-05-02
- [Fixed] Wrap `getCurrentPositionCallbacks` in `synchronized` block to prevent `ConcurrentModificationException` if `getCurrentPosition` is called in quick succession.

## [1.2.0] - 2016-05-01
- [Added] Introduce new [Scheduling feature](http://shop.transistorsoft.com/blogs/news/98537665-background-geolocation-scheduler)

## [1.1.1] - 2016-04-15
- [Fixed] Refactor `startOnBoot` system.  Added missing instruction to configure `BootReceiver` in `AndroidManifest`.  See [Installation Guide](https://github.com/transistorsoft/react-native-background-geolocation-android/wiki/Installation)
- [Added] Android `heartbeat` event, configured with `heartbeatInterval`.

## [1.1.0] - 2016-04-04
- [Fixed] Android 5 geofence limit.  Refactored Geofence system.  Was using a `PendingIntent` per geofence; now uses a single `PendingIntent` for all geofences.
- [Fixed] Edge-case issue when executing `#getCurrentPosition` followed immediately by `#start` in cases where location-timeout occurs.
- [Changed] Volley dependency to official version `com.android.volley`
- [Changed] When plugin is manually stopped, update state of `isMoving` to `false`.
- [Fixed] If location-request times-out while acquiring stationary-location, try to use last-known-location
- [Added] `maxRecordsToPersist` to limit the max number of records persisted in plugin's SQLite database.
- [Added] API methods `#addGeofences` (for adding a list-of-geofences), `#removeGeofences`
- [Changed] The plugin will no longer delete geofences when `#stop` is called; it will merely stop monitoring them.  When the plugin is `#start`ed again, it will start monitoringt any geofences it holds in memory.  To completely delete geofences, use new method `#removeGeofences`.
- [Fixed] Issue with `forceReloadOnX` params. These were not forcing the activity to reload on device reboot when configured with `startOnBoot: true`
- [Fixed] `stopOnTerminate: false` was not working.

## [1.0.1] - 2016-03-14
- [Changed] Standardize the Javascript API methods to send both a `success` as well as `failure` callbacks.
- [Changed] Upgrade plugin for react-native `v0.21.0`
- [Changed] Document new installation steps
- [Changed] Upgrade `emailLog` method to attach log as email-attachment rather than rendering to email-body.  The result of `#getState` is now rendered to the email-body
- [Changed] Android `getState` method was only returning the value of `isMoving` and `isEnabled`.  It now returns the entire current-configuration as supplied to the `#configure` method.
- [Added] Intelligence for `stopTimeout`.  When stop-timer is initiated, save a reference to the current-location.  If another location is recorded while during stop-timer, calculate the distance from location when stop-timer initiated:  if `distance > stationaryRadius`, cancel the stop-timer and stay in "moving" state.
- [Added] New debug sound **"booooop"**:  Signals the initiation of stop-timer of `stopTimeout` minutes.
- [Added] New debug sound **"boop-boop-boop"**: Signals the cancelation of stop-timer due to movement beyond `stationaryRadius`.
- [Added] `mapToJson`, `jsonToMap` methods.
- [Added] CHANGELOG
- [Added] Document `#getLog`, `#emailLog`
- [Fixed] When using setConfig to change `distanceFilter` while location-updates are already engaged, was mistakenly using value for `desiredAccuracy`

## [1.0.0] - 2016-03-08
- [Changed] Introduce new per-app licensing scheme.  I'm phasing out the unlimited 'god-mode' license in favour of generating a distinct license-key for each bundle ID.  This cooresponds with new Customer Dashboard for generating application keys and managing team-members.
- [Changed] Upgrade plugin for react-native v `0.20.0`.

## [0.4.0] - 2016-02-28

- [Fixed] Fix bug transmitting `motionchange` event.
- [Fixed] HTTP listener not being called on server error
- [Fixed] Fix location-timeout; wasn't being fired in right thread.
- [Added] `#insertLocation` method for manually adding locations to plugin's SQLite db
- [Added] `#getCount` retrieve count of records in plugin's SQLite db.
- [Changed] Upgrade react-native dep to 0.19.0
- [Changed] Significant refactor of `LocationManager`
- [Changed] SQLite multi-threading support.
- [Changed] Native HTTP layer will not follow HTTP `301` (redirect) response.
- [Changed] Cache `odometer` between app restart / device reboot.
- [Added] `@param {Boolean} foregroundService` Allow service to run as "foreground service".  This makes the service more impervious to closure by OS due to memory pressure.  Since a foreground service must display a persistent notification in Android notifiction-bar, config-params for modifying the `@param {String} notificaitonTitle`, `@param {String} notificationText` and `@param {String} notificationColor`.
- [Added] Methods `getLog` and `emailLog` for fetching the current applicaiton log at run-time.

## [0.3.1] - 2016-02-20
